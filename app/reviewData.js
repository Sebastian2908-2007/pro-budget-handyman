        text:'Other than a small hiccough with scheduling, Anthany was where he said he would be, and did what he said heâ€™d do. Though it cost me a little more than I was hoping to spend, Anthonys rates are reasonable and the quoted number of hours for the job was pretty close to what it took. Thank you Anthany, I appreciate you!'

        text:'Anthany was amazing. He replaced my old kitchen faucet. The old one was stuck and he tried until he got it out. Very professional and very punctual. He said he would be here at 10:30 am and he was here at that time. He was fast and also very easy to work with. He did an amazing job. Also he was easy to get a hold of. Once I requested my quote he answered within the hour and was able to come the next day. I 100% recommended him to anybody'

        text:'Anthony did a wonderful job! He was quick and efficient. He gets the job done but doesnt charge you an arm and a leg. He is hardworking and trustworthy! I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking for a handyman! He can practically do anything! He is also patient. He had to run a bunch of errands for the projects I had him do and I even surprised him with one I didnt talk to him about and he willingly did it! I am so grateful for all his hard work and his skills!'
